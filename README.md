# Assessing Species Extinction

This project was a class project for [Data Science for Global Change Ecology (ESPM 157)](https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/), an undergraduate class taught by Carl Boettiger at UC Berkeley. 

## Team Members

This was a group project conducted by 2 team members:

- Grace Pratt, gracepratt
- Sarah Tang, sarahtang

In this repo, we explore species extinctions and determine how many different species go extinct per year based on type of species. We access data from restful APIs to determine when species went extinct starting from 1500. We then classify these species based on taxonomic groups to calculate the MSY (the number extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years).
